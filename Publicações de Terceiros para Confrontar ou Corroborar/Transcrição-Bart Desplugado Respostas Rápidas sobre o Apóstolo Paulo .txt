2:08
Welcome back to Misquoting Jesus, where today we are answering listeners questions about the Apostle Paul. We've
2:14
also got a book recommendation from Bart. So, make sure you stop by for that. Bart, before we get to Paul, how
2:20
are you doing? Uh, yeah. Well, uh, I'm doing well. We're, you know, getting into the
2:26
semester about halfway now. And it's fun watching the students because the beginning of the the semester right
2:32
after summer, you know, they're filled with vim and vigor. And even in an 8:00 class, they're rare and to go. and now
2:38
they're kind of dragging themselves in trying to get awake. So, you have to you have to really kind of, you know, be a
2:45
little bit more entertaining just to kind of keep things going at this stage of the semester, but it's all good. Extra hard to get their eyes to open.
2:52
Yeah, it's all good. Yeah. How how you doing? Yeah. Similarly, dragging actually. Um I
2:58
like I like the cooling down of the weather. I really like autumn. Uh but the being dark in the morning, I really
3:05
struggle with pulling myself out of bed. Uh which is necessary because otherwise otherwise I get jumped on by uh two very
3:12
small, very excited children. Um Right. Yeah. Which is is fun, but occasionally
3:18
a knee will land on a rib cage, which is, you know, Yeah. Well, there's only so much fun a
3:24
person can stand. This is true, especially at 5:30 in the morning. Exactly.
3:30
Now, before we get to listeners questions, I have a an intro icebreaker type thing. Do you enjoy the public
3:38
debates that you do or do you consider them more just part of the job? Ah. Ah, well, I'll tell you, they're not
3:45
part of the job because most people don't do that. Most academics don't do them and refuse to do them and there's
3:52
no way in the world they're going to do them. Uh, and so, you know, I when I was in high school, I was into debate, so I
3:59
kind of like debate. And the thing is these debates, it it really depends whom I'm debating, but I rarely during the
4:06
time do I think they're fun. What I'll usually do is I'll get all pumped up for one and go into one and about 20 minutes
4:12
in, I start writing notes to myself saying, "Why are you doing this? Never again."
4:18
Well, and part of it is because uh you know, like almost always it's with somebody uh who has the crowd completely
4:25
on their side. You know, I'll go into a I'll have a debate with somebody. I've done this a number of times. I'll go in
4:31
and it'll be an evangelical apologist or an evangelist or something and there'll
4:36
be a crowd of three or 4 hundred people and I'll start off by asking how many of them are evangelical Christians and
4:42
everybody will raise their hand and then I'll say, "How many of you here to see me get creamed?" and everybody raises their hand. It's like, oh my god. So,
4:49
what's the point of this? But but the po the point is seriously though is that I I really do want people to see that you
4:56
can have another point of view that is honest and sincere and well thought out
5:02
and that it's not just out to destroy somebody's faith, but that it's but that it is actually it's worth thinking
5:08
about. And my experience is that even if you've got 300 people in the room, if
5:14
there are if there are just three people who are kind of sitting on the fence or who are open to another thing, it it can
5:19
make a big difference. It can make a big difference. And so um so I do it really. But it's it's more of a public service
5:26
than a passion. Yeah. Yeah. I believe it. I believe it.
5:33
Yeah. Okay. Paul and we said at the end of the last episode that we get a lot of
5:40
listeners questions in. So, we're going to start doing maybe once a quarter an episode where we are just trying to
5:46
address the questions that you all send in because people have been waiting for a while to hear answers to some of their questions. We are doing themed episodes
5:53
just to make a little bit easier for organization um and for honestly my brain to keep track of everything. And
6:00
we're opening with Paul. So, why are the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels so
6:06
different to the teachings of Paul? I thought that being written decades later, the Gospels would teach the same
6:11
thing as Paul or at least be consistent with him, but they are completely different. Why is that?
6:17
You know, I think there's a problem that uh most people have reading the New Testament who understand it historically
6:23
that Paul's our Paul gives us our earliest writings and he's writing before the gospels. And most people
6:30
reading the New Testament who know that, including lots and lots of scholars, simply assume that the gospel writers
6:37
must know Paul. I mean, of course, I mean, we know Paul. Why wouldn't they know Paul? They were writing the Bible.
6:43
And I think that it wasn't like that. I don't I'm not, you know, there are scholars who argue vehemently that that,
6:49
you know, this author knew Paul or knew Paul's writings or this author. And I'm not completely sure. I think that uh to
6:57
show that one author knew another knew another's writings, you can't just happen to have two authors living near
7:04
each other in terms of time and who have kind basically similar ideas. That doesn't mean they knew each other. Um
7:11
and so or that one had read the writings of the other. So I think there's there's a high bar of evidence. So I'm not sure
7:17
that that the writers did know Paul's letters. The other tricky thing about this is when we say did somebody know
7:24
Paul what scholars always mean is uh they agree that we have seven undisputed
7:29
letters and their question is did the gospel writers know these seven letters
7:35
and for me that question is just the wrong question in part because Paul must
7:40
have written hundreds and hundreds of letters his ministry lasted 30 years he
7:45
had 25 30 churches he was writing them regularly how many hundreds of letters Did he write? And we have seven. And so
7:53
what would make you think that the author of Mark knew one of these seven as opposed to some other seven or
7:59
opposed to like I mean so I just think you know unless you've got really compelling evidence. I think there is
8:04
some there are some things to suggest that maybe Mark understood Paul's thinking his theology but I don't know
8:09
any evidence he read his letters. And the thing is what Paul's theology was was common theology at his time. He's
8:16
not the only one who thought that the death and resurrection of Jesus brought about an atonement. I mean, he lots of
8:21
people thought that. So, the fact that Mark thinks that and Paul thinks that doesn't mean that Mark used Paul. Um, so
8:28
the question, this question though is why are they so different, not why are they so similar.
8:33
Well, um, they have different agendas. Paul is actually writing letters. These
8:39
are these are pieces of personal correspondence. He's not writing a narrative about Jesus uh life, death,
8:46
and resurrection, which is what the gospels are. And so they have they have different aims. Paul seems to be
8:53
completely uninterested in Jesus life, death, and resurrection. He said he only reports three of Jesus' teachings. What
9:00
he said at the last supper that you shouldn't get divorced and you ought to pay your preacher. That's those are the
9:05
only teachings he says. Doesn't mention anything about Jesus uh parables. Doesn't say anything about his miracles,
9:10
his casting out of demons. There's millions of things he doesn't say. So, he's just not he's writing letters to
9:15
deal with problems. But given that, why are his views so different in many ways?
9:22
Um, well, his views are different in some ways. Uh, Matthew and Paul seem to
9:27
be at odds in my judgment. They seem to be at odds about whether the Jewish law is still in force or not. Paul certainly
9:34
thought Jews should keep the Jewish law, but he didn't think Gentiles should. Matthew says that every followers of
9:40
Jesus have to keep the law. So that seems to be different. Why would they be different? Well, because they have different views. I mean, why do modern
9:46
Christians today have different views? We tend to think that if it's in the Bible, everybody has to have the same
9:51
view, you know, but they didn't have to they didn't have to pass qualifying exams to get into the Bible. They were just writing their books and they lived
9:58
in different places at different times with different views and so they so they were different. But it but um I would
10:04
say that Matthew is at odds with Paul. I think the most interesting case is the gospel of Luke because whoever wrote Luke also wrote the book of acts and
10:12
Paul is the hero of acts but Luke does not show evidence of knowing Paul's
10:17
theology in fact he Paul is very strong that
10:23
Jesus death brought an atonement for sins and Luke gets rid of all the atonement language from the gospel of
10:29
Mark and in his in the book of acts when the apostles preach they do not teach that Jesus death brought an atonement
10:35
for sins. And so that's that's a particularly uh interesting case. I would say
10:42
this is a similar question but from a slightly different angle. Is it possible that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were
10:48
a response to the gospel that Paul preached specifically Matthew chapter 6 or when he warns against a wolf in a
10:54
sheep's clothing? Um well I don't know. I mean, we don't know who what Matthew had in mind about
11:01
the wolf in sheep's clothing, except for that it was somebody who was teaching something contrary to him. I think you
11:06
can make a case that I I don't know that Matthew actually knew Paul's writings or
11:11
that he knew about his life. He may well have done. I don't know. Uh we don't know who Matthew was. We don't know who
11:18
this author is. We don't know where he lived. um he's almost certainly in some kind of major urban area where there was
11:24
a large Jewish congregation population and a large Christian population. And so some place like Antioch is sometimes
11:30
suggested or could be most any major city. Um and if it was a place like Antioch, he must have known about Paul.
11:37
Um but the thing about Matthew is that some of the things that he says do seem to be directed against the idea that
11:45
Paul advanced that Gentiles don't have to keep the law. Um, it's not completely
11:51
clear that Matthew thinks that Gentiles have to keep the law. Um, it it's
11:57
actually pretty tricky trying to figure that out. Um, what his view about Gentiles uh was, but uh, Matthew does
12:05
insist on following the law. Uh, that Jesus followers keep the law, but he's talking, you know, in the gospel, Jesus
12:10
is talking to Jewish followers. And so, I don't know what Matthew's view was. So, was Matthew a response to to Paul?
12:16
It's absolutely possible. uh but we don't we don't really know what made the Apostle Paul so
12:22
influential. It's clear from his writings there were different variants of Christianity that he preached against. So why was he so persuasive to
12:29
so many people so quickly? It's a great question and I think um to
12:35
follow up on the kind of sub point this person was making. It doesn't look like he was that influential during his
12:41
lifetime. This seems weird because we all think that Paul was the guy uh you
12:47
know you have Jesus then you got Paul but when you read when you actually read Paul's letters it's quite clear he has
12:54
more enemies than friends among the Christians. um every one of his just
12:59
about every one of his letters is is dealing with people who are have a different view from his or that are
13:07
attacking him and he has to defend himself and sometimes of course that's the same thing and they're different
13:13
issues. The letter to the Galatians is attacking those who say that that Gentiles have to become Jewish and that
13:20
was a dominant view and uh lots of people disagreed with Paul on that. uh
13:27
there are uh indications that he didn't get along with Peter and James about the implications of his gentile mission in
13:34
Galatians in in Corinth the issue is that people have a different understanding of the future resurrection
13:41
of the dead which for Paul is a central theme and they get they they reverse they have a different understanding from
13:48
his and when you read all these letters he's dealing with Christians who are saying contrary things very rarely
13:55
really does he mention somebody that like an entire group of people agree with him on everything and when he says
14:00
that it's always with contingencies. I mean he says that he and the apostles will agree on this that and the other
14:06
thing and on some things they do but other things not. So why was Paul mo the most influential?
14:12
There have been lots of theories over time since the 19th century that in the second century Paul was not particularly
14:20
influential. The uh church father Tutoleium calls him the apostle of the
14:25
heretics because he was he was beloved of the marcianite Christians who believed that
14:32
there were two gods and that the god of the old testament was not the god of Jesus and claimed Paul as the support.
14:38
He's beloved of many gnostic groups who understood him to be proclaiming a kind of gnostic gospel. Um and so so there
14:46
were and so Tutoleum called him the god the apostle of the heretics. In more
14:52
recent times uh scholars have have tried to show in fact no no he he was influential in orthodox protoorthodox
14:59
circles as well. Why does he become the important figure? Um in part it's
15:04
because he was his teaching his writings could be used to oppose various kinds of
15:10
views that orthodox considered to be heretical. And so um and so people
15:15
started championing him uh and he is quoted early on and it's just probably
15:21
because he you know he wrote a lot he wrote a lot of letters and people knew about them.
15:26
The earliest reference to the Lord's supper is in 1 Corinthians 11 where Paul states that he received it from Jesus.
15:33
Since this ritual is something Paul claims to have been revealed to him. Is it possible that he himself is the
15:38
source of the Lord's supper and it became part of the Christian tradition and the gospels through him?
15:44
Uh, it's possible. Um, he doesn't say, "I got it from Jesus." He says, "I got it from the Lord." Um, and that could
15:52
mean a variety of things. Um, I think a lot of people just kind of assume it
15:58
means that Jesus told him about it sometime, like maybe when he converted, but that seems implausible to me. I
16:04
don't think that Jesus was giving him extensive instruction. What Paul says is that the Christ appeared to me. He
16:10
doesn't say that he instructed me. Um so I and or that let alone gave him a
16:16
biography of his life or what he did the last night or anything like that. Um
16:21
when Paul says he's learned this from the Lord, it's you know, as I said, it can mean a range of things. People today
16:27
say, you know, the Lord's teaching me X, Y, and Z or uh the Lord heard my prayer,
16:33
you know, or the Lord and you said to me and and they don't mean that like they
16:38
went up to heaven to talk with Jesus for a while. Sometimes they might mean that, but that's not normally what they mean. And so to hear something from the Lord
16:45
could mean that uh something's come in your head and you you realize that this has been an inspired thought. It could
16:51
mean that in in Paul's churches, it could mean that a prophet was speaking um and a prophet declared something uh
16:58
thus sayeth the Lord. Anyone who's been in a charismatic group as I was for a while or a Pentecostal group is
17:04
accustomed to prophets speaking the word of God and that those are messages coming from the Lord or those who speak
17:10
in tongues whose uh message is interpreted. These are messages from the Lord. And so it's not it's not it's not
17:18
clear what he means by that. He is the first one to give these words at the uh
17:23
Lord's supper in 1 Corinthians 11. His um
17:29
so yeah so he is the first to give that there are variations of these words among the gospels. Um his form of it uh
17:38
is uh is similar to what you get in Luke. Matthew and Mark have different kind of a different form of it. But um
17:45
did Paul start it? Uh well I don't think so. I mean, when I think Paul's Paul's
17:52
communities were practicing this, but I think that I think that the idea that there was a commemorative meal where
17:58
people were remembering what Jesus said at the last supper probably predates Paul, certainly his letters. So, I don't
18:03
think he started it. Do comments from Paul that Jesus was found in the form of God and that he was
18:10
rich yet for our sakes became poor reflect an incarnational christologology? And what could Jesus
18:16
prior richness and subsequent exaltation otherwise mean giving that his standing in this world was always lowly?
18:24
Uh it's a great question. This is referring to a passage in Philippians chapter 2 6-10 where um principally that
18:32
but also 2 Corinthians chapter 8:9 which says that even though he was rich he became poor for our sake. So for just to
18:40
start with that one it's a very brief passage. uh Paul is trying to instruct the Corinthians that they need to uh
18:46
provide funds that he's raising for the uh the saints in Jerusalem who are are
18:53
having uh real real trouble because there's a drought and he's trying to provide funds for them so they can uh
18:59
support themselves. And so he's trying to get the Corinthians to donate and he's reminding them that Jesus even
19:05
though he's rich became poor for our sake. And he's not talking about like Jesus being a wealthy man in Nazareth.
19:11
you know, who gives up his penthouse so that he can, you know, give to the poor. He's talking about he's it appears to
19:17
mean that he he had the wealth of heaven and he became human. And support for that is this passage in se is in
19:24
Philippians chapter 2. one of one of the most commented uh on passages of the entire New Testament by scholars which
19:30
starts off by saying that that Christ even though he was in the form of God did not regard equality with God
19:37
something to be grasped after but he emptied himself and came became a human
19:43
uh and became a slave and then he died on the cross for others and therefore God highly exalted him and bestowed upon
19:50
him the name that's above every name he he acquired the name of God at that point at the exaltation. And so I think
19:57
this is an incarnation christologology. It's an incarnation christologology is an understanding of Christ. A
20:03
christologology that's that has Christ begin in the heavenly realm and become a
20:09
human. And so it's high because it starts up there as opposed to the idea that Christ started out as a human and
20:15
became a divine being. This is a high christologology. Uh the the question asked how else could it be understood?
20:21
Well, it is understood in different ways. Um uh and I you know I got a question on my blog yesterday about just
20:28
this thing on my blog. Somebody asked is it you know what about these scholars who say that this is not about an
20:33
incarnation that it's actually portraying Christ like Adam that Adam
20:38
who was made in the image of God tried for equality with God by eating the
20:43
fruit. Uh and Christ did just the opposite. He was in the form of God and
20:48
he he didn't grasp after equality with God. And so Christ was exalted and Adam
20:54
sinned. And so that the idea there would would be that in this Philippians things Paul's not talking about incarnation.
21:01
He's talking about Christ as the second Adam. So it could be interpreted that way. It has been interpreted that way by
21:07
scholars. I don't think so though. I think it's clear that he's talking about Christ in a pre-incarnate form as having
21:15
somehow being like God. Um, in the Bible
21:21
there are there are supernatural beings with God up in heaven. And this is saying Christ was one of those before he
21:27
became a human. Thank you very much. We're going to take a brief break to have the sorry, we're
21:34
going to take a brief break to have some announcements and we'll be right back with more questions about Paul.
21:41
So, the reason I asked you at the beginning of the episode about whether or not you enjoyed public debates is
21:47
because you do actually have one coming up uh with Dr. Mike Lacona. It's going
21:52
to be a live in-person debate between you and Mike who's a Christian apologist and that is happening on Thursday the
21:58
20th of November. And the debate topic is who wrote the Gospels.
22:04
Bart, what can you tell us about this? Well, I've debated Mike a number of times. Uh, not on this topic. And I, um,
22:12
you know, among the people I debate, I I like Mike. I don't like everyone. Mike and I are friends. And so, uh, but we
22:19
disagree on, uh, on a lot of issues when it comes to the New Testament. And so, well, you know, they're they're called
22:25
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Were they written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, or how would we know? And, um, I
22:32
can assure you, Mike's going to probably be arguing, yes, they are. And I'm going to be say, "Yeah, what makes you think
22:38
so?" Because I don't think so. And here's why I don't think so. One thing is these guys did not write Greek.
22:46
And so, so it's that kind of thing. So, um, we will both be uh presenting our
22:51
cases, uh, about what what we think. And no, the idea is so people can see both
22:56
sides and then make a decision. The problem is that I pointed out is that he'll have his fans there and people you
23:02
follow my stuff will be there and like they're already going to think things. But I hope people approach it with an open mind. Um even though Mike and I
23:09
probably will not be like the reality is I've I don't know
23:15
about Mike. I've thought about this issue since I was 17. And so I this is
23:20
uh you know so I I have reasons for what I think and I'm sure Mike has his reasons. This is going to be an in-person event.
23:27
is taking place in Boston. You can also attend virtually if you can't make it up to Boston. So for details and tickets,
23:34
you can visit bartermanman.com/boston. And we also have a very quick reminder.
23:40
Bart is going to be recording his earliest Christian heresies course this weekend. That's Saturday and Sunday the
23:48
8th and 9th of November. So this is your last chance to attend live and participate in the Q&A. You can go to
23:54
bartermanman.com/heresy. That's h e s y to sign up.
24:01
And we are back for more questions about Paul. How did Paul the Apostle convince the already existing apostles,
24:08
particularly Peter, to accept the authority of his own apostilhip to the extent where Paul rebuked Peter
24:15
publicly? What is your angle assuming that uh Paul received no detailed revelation and no apostle witnessed a
24:21
resurrected Christ? Wait, give me that last part. What What's my what what is your uh your angle, your
24:28
explanation if we assume that Paul didn't receive um any re revelation and
24:33
that no one witnessed a resurrected Christ? Well, I I think Paul thought he did see the resurrected Christ. I mean, uh I I'm
24:41
pretty sure about that. I think that Paul believed that he saw Jesus. He doesn't tell us anything about that
24:47
encounter um other than he saw Jesus and he's and he says God revealed his son to
24:53
me but so it could mean anything. I mean it could could mean a wide range. It could mean anything. It could mean a
24:58
wide range of things. It could mean that he had a hallucination. It could mean that he um saw somebody in the distance
25:04
that he assumed as Jesus. It may have been a mistaken identity. He may have been dreaming. It it may have been Jesus
25:10
appeared to him. If you're a Christian, you say, "Well, yeah, Jesus appeared to him." So it could be any range of things. Um how did he convince the other
25:17
apostles? I don't know. But uh my sense is that he insisted he saw him and they believed him and that he the way he
25:24
described his experience was comparable to what they themselves were claiming about themselves. And um and they
25:30
believed him. Um and so how did he how did he convince them? I don't know. I we
25:35
don't know. We don't know. He the bigger problem for Paul was convincing them that his message about that Gentiles
25:42
don't have to be Jews to be followers of Jesus. The big the big struggle was getting them to accept that. He says
25:49
that he did succeed in that. But then later Peter drew implications about that that
25:55
Paul didn't draw about whether it was okay then for Jews and Gentiles to be sharing meals together. Peter thought
26:01
probably not. Paul thought absolutely yes. And so they did have conflicts over that one.
26:07
At what point historically do the letters of Paul begin to triumph over the supposed words of Jesus? And are
26:14
they there any early writings known that ask the obvious question essentially
26:19
Paul who are you that didn't walk with Jesus to be telling us what to believe? Um my sense is Christians would
26:27
throughout history would never say that Paul triumphed over Jesus. Um but it is
26:33
the case I think that Paul taught that Jesus death and resurrection are brought
26:38
what brought salvation whereas Jesus taught that the kingdom of God is coming soon and people need to repent of their
26:45
sins so that God will forgive them. Those are different messages even though even today people don't realize those
26:51
are different messages. Um Jesus did not teach that somebody has to die for sins. The historical Jesus didn't teach that.
26:58
Um and so um we know we start finding evidence that Paul's letters are being
27:05
treated as scriptural authorities as being the word of God. Um, going back to
27:11
New Testament times, second Peter 3:16, uh, an author who claims to be Peter,
27:18
almost certainly was not Peter, with this person claiming to be Peter, um, says that his opponents uh, have twisted
27:26
the meanings of Paul's letters as they do with the rest of the scriptures. And so, he seems to be seeing Paul's letters
27:32
as scripture. They begin to be quoted as scripture. And so the idea was that not only did Christ appear to Paul, but that
27:38
God inspired him to write his letters. And if they're inspired, then they're authoritative. And if you've got
27:44
authoritative writings of Paul and you have authoritative gospels and you think they're all authoritative, um, you don't
27:50
pay that close attention to where the contradictions are. You look at where they're they're similar and you read
27:56
them in light of each other. And that's what Christians have always done until the modern period where scholars pointed
28:02
out actually these are different and they're saying different things. I believe it is possible that Paul never
28:08
actually converted rather he continued his persecution of Christians by trying to undermine Christianity from with
28:14
within. Has any historian believed that this was the case? And do you think that it is plausible?
28:20
I don't know of anybody who said historian said that. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody said it because
28:25
most things somebody said at some point or another. I don't think it's plausible. No, I don't. I I think that
28:32
there's no evidence of it. um every piece of evidence we have points in the
28:37
other direction. So if we had only one piece of direct one piece of evidence, it'd be one thing, but like everything
28:42
points the other way. Um and so I uh I including Paul's writings of course, but
28:49
including you know the book of Acts or references to Paul I mean so I think it's pretty clearly no.
28:56
I am reading Stanley Porter's book, When Paul Met Jesus, in which he argues that it is more probable than not that Paul
29:02
had a face-to-face encounter with Jesus during Jesus earthly life. What do you think is the likelihood that Paul met,
29:08
heard of, or had an encounter with Jesus during his lifetime? I haven't read Stanley's book. Um, he's
29:16
a uh he's a smart guy. He knows a lot. He's an evangelical scholar. Um, I don't
29:21
know of any evidence that that's the case. Um Jesus was ministering in
29:27
Galilee for his entire uh ministry until the last week. He spoke Aramaic. He was
29:34
in the countryside. He was in small villages and hamlets. He wasn't in big cities. Um he and he didn't speak Greek.
29:42
Paul shows no evidence of knowing Aramaic. Paul shows no evidence of having traveled in Israel. Uh and so
29:48
Paul says nothing about this. Uh the gospels say nothing about it. the book of Acts says nothing about it. Uh and so
29:54
I think that it it's an interesting hypothesis but uh I I don't think there
29:59
I can't imagine what actual evidence there would be for it. Is it possible that f that Paul
30:05
converted to Christianity and then had a vision of Jesus afterwards?
30:11
Yeah, it's possible. I mean I don't know what would make you think so. and you know all you know when when people come
30:17
up with hypothetical things again I think it's it's really important to come up with hypothesis to explain history
30:22
because if you don't have a hypothesis you can't pursue it to find out oh actually that's true but once you have the hypothesis it's not a question of
30:29
just saying could this have been I mean you can't ask of course you should ask that if it's a hypothesis but in order
30:35
to believe it's right you have to find evidence and I don't know of any evidence of that and so um and so if
30:43
somebody has evidence they have to mount mount the case and then see whether it holds up or not. Thank you. And our final question for
30:49
today, is it likely that Paul was a mythical figure who did not exist?
30:55
No. I mean, uh, okay. So,
31:02
um, we we have a group of letters that all claim to be written by the same person,
31:08
um, who, uh, with a consistent writing style, consistent theological views, um,
31:16
consistent consistent perspective on things, ethics, doctrines, and such. Um,
31:22
they're written by somebody. They're claimed to be Paul. This person is known to, uh, other authors. uh he is
31:30
mentioned by other authors independently of his writings. He uh is mentioned by
31:35
authors of the New Testament. His death is known about uh by uh by a Roman
31:41
somebody living in Rome around the year 95 who speaks about him dying uh uh being martyed. We have so we have we
31:48
have extensive references to him and writings apparently by him.
31:55
And so if somebody thinks he didn't exist, well, what's the evidence he didn't exist? And what
32:01
I can't think of any evidence. I know people say this. Mythsist sometimes mythicists say this because they when
32:08
when somebody points out that one really good evidence that Jesus existed is that Paul knew his brother
32:14
and his closest disciple Peter. And so like if Paul knew these people and you know and spent time with them, then you
32:21
know if Jesus didn't exist, you'd think they would know, right? And people say, "Yeah, well, you know, the deal is that,
32:26
you know, Paul actually didn't write that letter, you know, or Paul never said that or Paul didn't exist himself." Well, okay. You know, maybe Abraham
32:32
Lincoln didn't exist. I mean, I don't know. I mean, how would you make the argument, though? Of course, they you got pictures and things, but with how
32:38
would you make the argument? And so, I don't know. I I don't think I don't think that uh I don't think there's
32:43
really I think that's a dead end, frankly. And you know, I think one of the problem with a lot of these kind of
32:48
hypotheses that I think again we should prop profound them and try and find evidence for them. But I think one
32:55
difficulty is that often they're propounded by people who want to who have like a reason to want to disprove
33:02
Christianity. And the way to do that is to say, "Yeah, Paul never really there was never a
33:07
Paul. There was never a Jesus." And that's a way of kind of showing that the whole thing is built on myth. And for
33:14
me, it's not the best approach because you're not going to convince anybody
33:19
like that um who doesn't want to be convinced already. So if your goal really is to show the problems of
33:25
Christianity, I think it's better to deal with the actual data and the actual information and to show why why the
33:31
actual information we have is problematic rather than than coming up with a hypothesis that most people
33:37
aren't going to buy. Bart, thank you very much. audience. Thank you also for your questions. We're
33:43
going to be doing um another one of these in a couple of months. So, if we didn't get to yours, we'll get there
33:48
eventually. Think you've got Jesus parables all figured out? Think again. These aren't
33:55
just simplistic moralistic tales. They're some of the most enigmatic and provocative teachings in all of
34:02
scripture. But if you're only seeing them through a modern lens, you're missing half the story.
34:08
Rediscover these stories as they were originally understood in their historical and cultural context with New
34:14
Testament and Jewish studies scholar Dr. Amy Jill Lavine in her intriguing course, The Parables of Jesus, Jewish
34:21
Insights into Gospel Ethics, Humor, and Provocation. You'll explore the teachings of Jesus, examining the
34:27
social, ethical, and economic implications that are often overlooked today. If you're ready to dive into the
34:34
real meaning behind the Good Samaritan, the prodigal son, and more, this four lecture series will take you deeper than

All right, our bonus this week is Bart's books, where Bart gives us a recommendation for an influential book
35:06
on the New Testament or early Christianity that he thinks we should read. Bart, what are you recommending
35:12
this week? Well, so since we just had a Q&A session on Paul, uh I thought I'd recommen
35:18
recommend a book on Paul. Um there are there are millions of books written about the Apostle Paul. Um and uh many
35:24
of them are very good. There was a there was a change in the understanding of how to approach Paul in the 1980s um where
35:32
for for almost all of time when people studied Paul they were really interested in his theology. You know what what were
35:40
his views about Christ about salvation about God about everything. What were
35:45
his views? And in the 1980s there started to be a movement toward uh what
35:50
was called so social history of early Christianity where people got interested in more kind of sociological issues
35:57
about like what Christianity really was and there was a very important book written by Wayne Meeks me ks that was
36:06
called the first urban Christians and it it was it was a book that kind of helped
36:12
drive the social history question and the book is the book does deal somewhat
36:17
with what Paul's you know what Paul's faith faith beliefs were but he's interested in other things what did it
36:24
mean to be a Christian community in an urban setting what how did how did the
36:31
communities come together like just like you know actually on the ground how did Christianity work how did they how did
36:38
they practice their rituals what do the rituals mean as kind of as kind of s
36:44
social symbols of something and how what what kind of people were in these churches, what were their economic
36:50
levels, uh what were their education levels, what were they how many people
36:55
were slaves, uh how active were women. Uh and so these are these are kind of
37:00
issues about like real life Christianity as opposed to the ethereal world of belief. So this book had a huge impact.
37:07
Uh Wayne Meeks was a professor at Yale University. uh was one of the really
37:13
prominent scholars of at the end of this of the 20th century. Uh brilliant
37:18
brilliant man who uh this book is very interesting and so that that's a book I would highly recommend. Wayne makes the
37:25
first urban Christians. Thank you very much. Bart audience, thank you all for listening. I hope you

And misquing Jesus will be back next week. Bart, what are we talking about next time?
37:56
Yeah. Yeah. Well, so next time, you know, a few times we've talked about Gnosticism uh on the podcast and uh
38:02
we're we're going to have a more targeted uh issue which is one of the really interesting ones, which is what did what did Gnostics generally think
38:09
about Jesus? What I mean, who was he? And you know, was he God? Was he human? Was he both? Was he two things? Was he
38:15
what what was he? And Gnostic had an unusual view that most people will not have heard of. And so we'll get to that.
