It is hard to believe Prof.Ehrman is retiring. Well deserving, he will be missed.He is undoubtedly one of my favourite people on biblical teachings. I have five of his books and the views are compelling and well researched. His 'burst laugh' is memorable.

How refreshing and instructive it has been to listen to an agnostic/atheist scholar who admits (1) that he lost his faith due to the problem of evil, NOT problems with the bible; (2) that those problems with the bible do not undermine liberal Christian faith, only fundamentalist/evangelical forms of religion; and (3) that a Christian can be as educated and intelligent as any agnostic or atheist...even, he says with a smile, smarter than he is. Let's hope that Dr. Ehrman continues his invaluable teaching here at the greatest and most affordable university of all, Internet U.

The point of those debates is that it plants a seed in people, especially evangelicals, that there may be another way of viewing the world. There were many "breadcrumbs" that opened my eyes. Just because you do not "win" the debate does not mean you are not the victor. Opening the eyes of people, even one person, is the greatest conquest.

The main thing people forget about first-century Christianity is that there were different laws for Jews and Gentiles.  The gospels have Jesus preaching exclusively to Jews and instructing them to keep the entire Torah forever; Paul's letters are addressed to Gentiles, assuring them that they DO NOT have to keep laws which are exclusively for Jews.  Some Orthodox Rabbis and scholars write that the early Jewish-Christians taught the Noahide laws to Gentile-Christians.  An excellent book on that subject is Rabbi Harvey Falk's 1985 book  "Jesus the Pharisee."

On Paul and Aramaic even if we assume that Paul's own family was from a sufficiently Hellenised Jewish group that he'd have grown up speaking Greek, if we take the mention of his education possibly in Jerusalem in acts to be accurate would he not have likely had a lot of exposure to Aramaic there? And while maybe he was relying on a translator he seems to have been in conversation with apostles whom would probably have been most comfortable in Aramaic.

Though a born Catholic, I became enamoured of Greek mythology at a young age. Later on, I studied Theology.
It occurred to me that there is quite a bit of overlap between some Greek mythology and some Biblical stories (Elijah feeding the Poor Woman is incredibly similar to Zeus and Hermes visiting the Poor Couple, for instance).
But going on from that, I also came to realise that people who grew up with a "theology" built around the Greek myths might find it incredibly easy to accept that Jesus was actually "God" in disguise (in much the same way - though, of course for very different purposes(!) - as Zeus disguising himself as a Swan to "get to know" Leda).
Modern humans, even those of us who like mythology, know that these Mythological stories are fictional - yet Christianity still seems to build much of its Theology as though these myths and the mythical world view were real...

I was surprised to hear Bart's answer to why Paul's ideas became so influential in the later church, because the answer seems obvious to me (and Bart has alluded to it many times in the past):

Paul was an evangelist to the gentiles, he was focused on spreading the religion and making it palatable to gentiles. Mimetic theory shows us that the most popular ideas are spread the widest and this is clearly the case with Paul. He wasn't popular among the Jewish Christians at the start of the movement, because he said things that Jews wouldn't like to hear (that the old commandments didn't apply to gentile Christians, but they did apply to Jews), but once the movement spread to gentiles through him, his ideas were spread and not the ideas of the Jewish Christians...

The most surprising finding when studying the origins of Christianity through Paul and the Synoptic Gospels is that Christian doctrine originates with Paul, not in the Synoptic Gospels. The latter serve only to validate the Pauline doctrine preached to the Gentiles. Without Paul's epistles, it becomes impossible to understand Christian doctrine as presented in the Synoptic Gospels. This situation is incomprehensible and should prompt researchers to question the true connection between Paul and his small group and the Jewish disciples of Jesus in Jerusalem. This is all the more true given that the Epistle to the Galatians reveals significant differences between these two groups.

I don’t remember where I read or heard that James the Just, the brother of Jesus who headed the Jerusalem church after Jesus’ death, above Peter or John, when he met Paul he asked him how he knew that the voice he heard on the road to Damascus was indeed Jesus’… and not a Demon’s. When Jesus was asked how you get saved, he is quoted as answering (Matthew 25) that you get saved by following Mosaic Law, and by your deeds; you’d be judged by whether you fed the hungry, visited the imprisoned etc., he never mentioned that you’d be asked what was your faith in judgement day, or whether you believed in his death and resurrection for the redemption of our sins. Christ supposedly knew all along he’d be crucified. If you are saved by your faith alone, why did he lie to the people who were asking him how to save themselves? And why was his answer on that day passed on by his followers all the way to our own times? On the other hand, if as Jesus said you are saved by been good, as expressed by your good deeds, your love for your neighbor, etc., then it would make sense that, if it was a demon who spoke to Paul, the demon would use Paul to mislead Jesus’ followers away from salvation, by telling them they’d be saved by their faith, and by their faith alone, and since Jesus already died for their sins, they somehow had carte blanche to sin, those sins were already preemptively redeemed, as long as they professed the right faith in Jesus’ death and resurrection for our sins. 2000 years sending well meaning Christians to hell! It sure seems like something the devil would do. Jesus warned us false prophets would follow, and one perhaps took his faith hostage right off the gate! On the other hand, it doesn’t make sense that until Jesus died for us, we had the means to save ourselves by being good. According to Matthew 25, people of other faiths (such as the Good Samaritan, or the people in the parable of the sheep and the goats), or such as people living in the far end of the world, would have been saved, nevertheless, had they fed the hungry etc. but after Jesus’ death, all of a sudden the 99.9% of the inhabitants of the planet who had not heard of him were all doomed, and to this day, everyone professing other faiths is doomed whether they are good or not. If that were how it works, then Christ came to entrap us rather than save us and to send to hell a larger number of people than would have gone to hell had he not died for our sins. Lots of good people are suddenly sent to hell no matter what they do. That doesn’t make a lot of sense if god is good, is just, and loves us. Apparently he doesn’t love us for being good, he only loves us if we believed he had his own son murdered for our sake? God had the power to forgive our sins by snapping his fingers (he’s omnipotent). Instead he sent his son to us so that if we added to all our sins the extra sin of murdering said son, then he’d save us, but if we failed to murder him… then he would have sent us all to hell, for not being murderous enough??? The more I think about it, the less sense it makes. Unfortunately it is impossible separate what Christ really preached from what a potentially demonic voice dictated to Paul. Paul’s letters predate every other part of the New Testament, and his church ended up declaring heretic any other churches that followed Jesus’ teachings directly, and not as reinterpreted by Paul. Too bad. I would have liked to know what that religion was like.

I also think the Abraham Lincoln analogy is a pretty poor non analogous argument from Bart.  But Bart is a biblical scholar not a historian. A historian would say:

Everything else is a best-fit hypothesis built on textual inference.

On if the gospel writers knew Paul's writings:  Paul stated in 1 Cor 11 he got his revelation of the Lord's Supper directly revealed from the Lord, and the synoptic Gospels follow what he said rather closely, with Luke diverging from the other two to follow significantly more closely with Paul's teachings such that it is clear Luke had a copy of Mark and of 1 Cor 11:24&24 and chose to stick with Paul in the places where Mark chose to diverge.

Edit:  hmmm a later question visited this directly.  Paul makes it clear in Galatians 1:11&12 that his gospel is directly revealed  from Jesus and not from any man, and in 2 Cor 12 he explains he received this revelation 14 years earlier when he was "caught up in the 3rd Heaven."  

I agree that some form of Eucharist was probably already being practiced in the early churches, and that may have had influence on his formal explanation of the ceremony irregardless of him claiming he got it directly from Jesus.  But the bulk of the Gospel Eucharistic ceremony came from Paul, especially for Luke.

Chaplinesque

By Hart Crane
We make our meek adjustments,
Contented with such random consolations
As the wind deposits
In slithered and too ample pockets.

For we can still love the world, who find
A famished kitten on the step, and know
Recesses for it from the fury of the street,
Or warm torn elbow coverts.

We will sidestep, and to the final smirk
Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb
That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,
Facing the dull squint with what innocence
And what surprise!

And yet these fine collapses are not lies
More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;
Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.
We can evade you, and all else but the heart:
What blame to us if the heart live on.

The game enforces smirks; but we have seen
The moon in lonely alleys make
A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,
And through all sound of gaiety and quest
Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.

Jesus, Paul... two different communication styles... two different audiences. Regarding the Law, Paul said that the law is "good" as he emphasized it's failings—just as Jesus said not one jot nor tittle will pass away till all is fulfilled. In other words, the law has a limited purpose. What is that purpose and what fulfills it? King David could answer that easily without disagreeing with either Jesus or Paul.

Jesus says in Matthew he hasn't come to abolish the Law, but the Law isn't intended for gentiles, at least not all of it. Jesus should say, "I have come to add to the Law by including gentiles in all of it and expecting them to follow everything in it including circumcision." I think in Rabbinic Judaism the Noahide laws apply to gentiles, so even in Rabbinic Judaism some of the Law can apply to gentiles but not all of it. I think what would be new is if all the Law applied to all of humanity, actually.

The imminence of the end began when Christ became a son to HaShem. Christ is from a place vast and forever peaceful. A kingdom was prepared there at the foundation of the world, a promised land, a heavenly home, a new heaven and new earth, the Garden of Eden.

I started from scratch. Crucifixion is a law of men. 

The Apostle Peter is the Cornerstone:


The wall of the city had twelve courses of stones as its foundation, on which were inscribed the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. (Rev 21:14 NABO)

It sems to me Paul didn't really change. He just changed sides. He went from a fanatical anti-Christian to a fanatical Christian.

Hitler used Martin Luther's "The Jews and Their Little Lies" as propaganda  as antisemitism to justify the Holocaust. Saul of Tarsus was a false prophet because his teachings were not from Yeshua and his " Messiah" never returned in his lifetime as he predicted. Orthodox Christianity needs to be deconstructed and Bart is helping to do so. 
You are doing God's work, Bart. God still loves you, Bart, even if you care or not.

Oh man. I just listened yesterday while doing chores, as I usually do and I’ve missed out on a chance to see Bart’s last lecture as registration is now closed.

Congratulations to you Bart on your retirement from UNC. It’ll be interesting to see what you’ll produce with more time devoted to these other endeavors.

Thank you for what you do.

Has bart ever considered that he may be misinterpreting the word gentile? Every time Paul enters a city in the NT he attends the synagogue. The audience he's speaking to is the synagogue audience yet he refers to them as gentiles. 

In todays day and age the word gentile = non jew. Yet the word in the ancient world meant people group under one rule. Even jews, and israel itself were called gentiles. 

Paul was most likely referring to the those from the 10 tribes as yeshuas message was towards them, as was the rest of the apostles. 

The context and point of Yeshua's message was the reunification of the 12 tribes under a renewed covenant. The first marriage covenant had to end by the death of the husband (god) represented by his shaliach in yeshua. This death freed the wife (israel) from her punishment of being an adulterer. 

Gentiles were the lost tribes in nearly every instance in the new testament. Hence why Shaul entered the synagogue. The people in the synagogue were israelites.

Israelites however were any race of people who chose to follow the covenant made at sinai.

Hence the message to gentiles were the come back to the covenant as is the message in every chapter of the bible from cover to cover.

It can also be corrected by surgery. If left, it will get worse.  By the way, I love this show, and good luck to Bart in his retirement. He deserves a rest after a life filled with scholarship and teaching.

Something bart said made me think of a question: if Paul wrote hundreds of letters, why would only seven be preserved, and why THOSE seven?  They’re not all to the same church, so somebody had to be going around collecting them, but not collecting all of them, just those.  Why?

I hate saving it because it could be used as an excuse for believers to use but at the same time, it can go the other way. There have been a lot of things destroyed overtime due to war and natural events. So there's maybe a chance that proof of Jesus's existence (like one letter to or from him or a journal of someone from the temple in Jerusalem) was destroyed. Or even anything in general. Maybe there's a letter or journal found that the empire was making Jesus up. I don't know. I'm 60/40 or 65/35, the higher leaning towards that Jesus didn't exist but if he did, he was 100% a human with no divinity and was shaped to be more of a mythological character than he was meant to be.

6:00 I think that Mark almost certainly knew Paul and a lot of Mark is reifying Pauline teachings. Mark is heavily mythologised, but I think Mark is trying to create a mythology to promote the Pauline sect, Matthew is doing the opposite, he´s probably trying to promote the original sect, or teachings closer to it.

My question for Bart: Why isn't more attention paid to Paul's lack of ability to be a viable "eye witness" of Jesus? He literally never met Jesus and had no ability to recognize Jesus even if he had seen him. Paul wouldn't know Jesus (as they say) if Jesus was standing right in front of him. There's been so much talk around Peter and Paul being the only eye witness who directly claimed to see Jesus, and we regularly disclaim that Paul's vision was "in the spirit" and not a physical body.

But I *never* hear anyone go further in regards to Paul: 

Paul cannot possibly be an eye witness of resurrected Jesus - for the same reason that my 10yo son or I can't be an eye witness for a sighting of resurrected Jesus: none of us have any idea what Jesus looked or sounded like. Jesus could literally be my neighbor across the street, and I'd have no idea. And conversely, Paul could have had a REAL spiritual sighting of Lucifer or Satan himself - and his "eye witness" testimony of seeing "Jesus" would be completely unchanged.

You can't testify about an eye witness sighting of someone if you literally have never met them and have no idea what they looked or sounded like.

Paul was 100% a false apostle. 

All of Asia Minor rejected Paul. They complained to James about Paul that he was trying to make them end the Laws. When Paul arrives in Jerusalem, James questions Paul in Acts 21:21 about this complaint which the people of Asia Minor made. James made Paul do a nazarite vow in Acts 21:26, which included shaving his head and animal sacrifice. So they were still sacrificing animals long after Jesus. 

The people of Asia Minor came back to Jerusalem and seen Paul. They dragged him out of the temple and beat him up and nearly killed him in Acts 21:27-32 for preaching against the Law of Moses. 

The Roman guards came and took Paul away and jailed him. Paul then writes to Timothy and says all of those in Asia Minor had rejected him in 2 Timothy 1:15. 

After Paul dies, Jesus is speaking to the people of Asia Minor. The very people who rejected Paul. Jesus is praising them for rejecting false apostles in Revelation 2:2.

The argument which no Christian can answer to is, why was Jesus  praising the enemies of Paul who nearly killed him? If Paul was a true apostle, then Jesus would have rebuked them. But he was praising the very people who rejected Paul, proving Paul could never have been a true apostle. Jesus never mentioned Paul even once to them. Even Barnabas completely fell out with Paul. The church is hiding this as they know most Christians don't read Bible and are just blindfollowers.

31:00 and 32:00 - what a load of ideological drivel! I've never heard a mythicist say such a thing. 

Is Dr Ehrman aware of Dr Nina Livesey's new book hypothesising that the Pauline epistles weren't written by Paul? The scholars taking that seriously are by no means mythicists. 

As far as it goes, Paul never met Jesus. He didn't "know Jesus' brother" either. He says in a letter, which he may not have even written himself, that he ONCE met "Jacob, brother of the lord". 

That's a lot less iron clad than saying he knew Jesus's biological brother, especially when Paul addresses all christians as "brothers" in his letters.

Of course Paul meant he learned it from the Lord, meaning Jesus (beginning at 15:27)... and absolutely, he claims to preach a Gospel (and ordinances by extension) as instructed and as revealed to him DIRECT from Jesus, Himself .  Read Galatians  Ch. 1, 11-12

11 Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that THE GOSPEL I PREACHED is not of human origin. 
12 For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I RECEIVED IT BY A REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.

11:42 The only time "Ravenous wolf" is used in the OT is about Benjamin. The only time "Ravenous wolves" is used in the NT is about false prophets. Paul is of the Benjamin tribe and preaches a completely different gospel to that of Jesus. Acts 8&9 are extremely wolf like behaviors/verbiage, some translations even use the word "ravaging" in saying Paul was "ravaging the church by entering house after house; DRAGGING off both men and women" (Acts 8:3 NRSVue). 

There's also the 'prophecy' that the serpent pharisees who are of their father Satan will go city to city persecuting the followers of Jesus - this is 'fulfilled' in acts 9 by Paul. Jesus says beware of the pharisees and herodians - Paul was both. 

As Jesus says, the pharisees were of Satan, serpents, and bad trees that *could not* bear good fruit, but they could whitewash and pretend to be followers of Jesus (wolves in sheep's clothing). 

Seems so obvious yet it isn't addressed by very many people. Paul was clearly the literally false prophet/test to see if people would follow the wide easy path of disregarding all the laws, wearing whatever they wanted, disobeying the sabbath, etc, or the difficult narrow path. James, 1 John and Jude all but say Paul's name when calling out his doctrine and stating a false apostle has infiltrated their ministry.

Jesus was conceived by his biological father Joseph through the announcement of the Holy Spirit. Jesus returned to all flesh in the Spirit of his Father at Pentecost. Jesus and his Father is the almighty and omnipresent Holy Spirit. There was no pre-existence of Jesus. Jesus was the chosen Son of God. Correct! Greetings

Honestly, this episode felt like a rambling lecture that barely scratches the surface while dressing it up as insight. Bart meanders through historical hypotheticals, constantly hedging with “maybe” and “I don’t know,” leaving listeners with more confusion than clarity. His repeated insistence that Paul “probably saw Jesus” or that Luke just “didn’t know Paul’s theology” comes off less like scholarship and more like hand-waving to defend pre-existing assumptions. The discussions on incarnation, the Lord’s Supper, or Paul’s supposed influence are delivered in a way that assumes agreement rather than proving anything; you’re told “it’s possible” or “we can’t know,” then treated to pages of interpretation as if that counts as explanation.

The pattern is clear: hypothetical musings without concrete evidence, with a heavy overlay of authority via credentials. Even when addressing contentious questions like Paul’s historicity or his relationship with the apostles, Bart sidesteps the hard historical evidence in favor of speculation and apologetic framing. It’s presented as critical inquiry, but it reads more like a defense of tradition than a rigorous examination. A listener seeking actual historical clarity on Paul versus the Gospels will walk away with anecdotes, interpretations, and vague theories—not real answers.

In short: long-winded, speculative, and self-congratulatory, packaged as scholarship, but ultimately frustrating if you want real historical rigor.
